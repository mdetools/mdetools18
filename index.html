                <br>

                <p class="lead">
                    This year workshop co-located with MODELS'18, Copenhagen, Denmark
                </p>

                <p> The easy availability of high-quality tools with effective supporting materials and documentation significantly increases the chances of adoption of any new software development approach. While there are many different significant obstacles to the development of such tools and materials, there is some evidence suggesting that the modeling community would benefit from an increased focus on the tools it produces and the support it provides to potential and actual users to compare, evaluate, and use them.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by “tool challenge and competition” workshops in other fields (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]) the MDETools Workshop intends to provide a forum in which </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>the strengths and weaknesses of existing MDE tools can be identified and discussed, </li>
                    <li>suitable evaluation and comparison criteria and processes can be determined,</li>
                    <li>the modeling community is encouraged to create and share materials that support MDE tools use more effectively, </li>
                    <li>and experitise and best practices for creating high-quality tools and materials efficiently can be collected.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> </p>

                    <p>The workshop welcomes regular paper submissions on these topics. But, to facilitate the comparison of tools, it also solicits submissions that demonstrate the use and utility of a specific MDE tool in the context of one of two ‘challenge problems’. Moreover, the workshop also features a ‘Video Tutorial’ track which challenges the community to create appealing video tutorials that describe the use of a tool for a specific purpose in an informative and accurate, but also effective and attractive way.</p>
