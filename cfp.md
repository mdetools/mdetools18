## Topics of interest
The workshop defines an MDE tool to be a tool that provides
support for the creation and/or use of models for some
significant development tasks (involving, e.g., creation, manipulation,
transformation, evolution, communication, generation,
execution, testing, simulation, or analysis) and that
offers benefit to the user through the effective use of some
or all of the three core principles behind MDE: abstraction,
automation, and analysis. Tools can come from industry or
academia and be freely available, open source, or commercial.

MDETools’18 welcomes submissions on aspects related to
the development and use of such tools and their supporting
materials.
MDETools’18 is particularly interested in the following
topics:

1. Convincing, insightful descriptions of the state-of-theart
in MDE tooling, in general and in the context of
the workshop challenge problem.
2. Criteria and approaches for objective, repeatable tool
evaluations and comparisons.
3.  Proposals for dealing with relevant tooling challenges
such as integration, interoperability, and usability, in
general or in the context of new or emerging applications
(such as the ‘digital twin’ and ‘digital thread’
concepts), and application domains (such as the systems
engineering, Industry 4.0, and the Internet of
Things).
4. Proposals on how to better leverage relevant standards
and community efforts (such as Open Services for
Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC), Microsoft’s Language
Server Protocol, the Eclipse ecosystem and open source
tools in general).
5. Proposals for facilitating the creation, maintenance
and dissemination of high-quality tools and materials.
6. Techniques and tools for the creation of attractive
documentation material, in general and in the context
of the video tutorial track.

## Submissions

### Categories
Submissions should fall into one of the
following categories:

<ol type="I">
  <li><strong>Research papers:</strong> describe new and innovative ways
how MDE tools and their development can be improved;
papers addressing relevant challenges, trends, and opportunities
(see ‘Topics of Interest’) are particularly
encouraged. </li>

  <li><strong>Comparisons and evaluations of MDE tools:</strong> describe
the tools compared or evaluated, criteria and
data collection processes used, and results obtained
in a novel, insightful way; models used and data collected
should be made publicly available. Descriptions
of novel ways to encourage or facilitate evaluations and
comparisons are also welcome.</li>

  <li><strong>Position papers:</strong> clearly describe a position or opinion
on a relevant topic (see ‘Topics of Interest’) in an
insightful way; papers discussing challenges to the development
of high-quality MDE tools and supporting
documentation and how they could be mitigated or
removed are particularly encouraged. </li>

<li><strong>Descriptions of MDE tool use in context of the
challenge problem:</strong> describe (1) how significant aspects
of the challenge problem have been addressed
with the help of an MDE tool or tools, and (2) the
strengths and weaknesses of the tool in the context
of the problem. All created models must be
made public and information about how they can be
obtained must be provided. </li>

<li><strong>Video tutorials:</strong> demonstrate the use of an MDE tool
for a particular task (or set of tasks) in an informative,
accurate, attractive, and polished way. Submissions
should be accompanied by a short summary containing
(1) a description of the contents of the tutorial including
the tool and task(s) chosen, and (2) a URL of the web
location where the tutorial can be accessed and viewed. </li>

</ol>



EasyChair will be used to handle the submissions of papers in Categories I to IV and of summaries of video tutorials. The submission link is: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mdetools18](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mdetools18).

### Format and size limits
All submitted artifacts must
use English. All textual documents must adhere to the [Springer LNCS formatting guidelines](http://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Research
papers (Category I), comparisons and evaluations of
MDE tools (Category II), position papers (Category III),
and descriptions of tool use in the context of the challenge
problem (Category IV), should be between 6 and 10 pages in
length. Video tutorials should not be longer than 10 minutes;
the accompanying summary should not exceed 2 pages.

### Publication 
Accepted papers and summaries of accepted
video tutorials will be published in the workshop
proceedings which will be made available using the openaccess
publication service CEUR [ceur-ws.org](http://ceur-ws.org).


### Evaluation process and criteria
The submission and reviewing process will be handled using
EasyChair. All submissions will be reviewed by at least three
PC members. Acceptance decisions will be made based on
standard criteria such as correctness, clarity, and originality,
but also on the potential of the work to stimulate discussion,
inspire participants, and contribute to the success of the
workshop. Moreover, video tutorials should convey knowledge
about how to use an MDE tool for a particular task or set of
tasks in an accurate, clear, succinct, and easy-to-follow way;
chosen tasks should be non-trivial and relevant to potential
users; the tutorial should be attractive and polished and use
the tutorial format effectively.
Submissions with workshop organizers as (co-)authors will
be allowed, but care will be taken to enforce the [standard conflict rules](http://www.sigsoft.org/about/policies/pc-policy.htm) when assigning papers for review, collecting reviews,
and discussing submissions.
