## Topics of interest
The workshop defines an MDE tool to be a tool that provides
support for the creation and/or use of models for some
significant development tasks (involving, e.g., creation, manipulation,
transformation, evolution, communication, generation,
execution, testing, simulation, or analysis) and that
offers benefit to the user through the effective use of some
or all of the three core principles behind MDE: abstraction,
automation, and analysis; tools can come from industry or
