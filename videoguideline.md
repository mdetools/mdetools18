## Guidelines:
 

Submissions of video tutorial should follow the following guidelines:

The primary goal of video tutorials is to promote a specific modelling tool and to help beginners get started with the tool. Therefore, basic and preliminary topics are preferable;
The video should be recorded using high-quality settings and video length should be less than 5 minutes;
The video should show applications of modelling tools with respect to the topics of interest of the workshop;
Each video should cover only one topic. If you intend to discuss more than one topic, it is suggested to create a separate video for each topic and submit them separately;
The topic covered by the video should be clearly defined in the video. Reviewers should be able to follow and reproduce the content of the video without having to consult  other sources or references. If it is required to install a particular version of the tool or if specific requirements have to be met in order to use the tool, the video should mention these requirements;
The use of subtitles, voice recording, and any other artifacts used to clarify the video is highly encouraged;
The video should mention the authors' names, preferably at the beginning of the video.
