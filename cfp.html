<p>Submissions should fall into one of the following four categories:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li><strong>Descriptions of MDE tool use and benefits in context of workshop challenge problems</strong> describe<br />
        (1) how significant aspects of either the ‘<a href="http://mase.cs.queensu.ca/mdetools/index.php?id=rover">Rover</a>’ or the ‘<a href="http://mase.cs.queensu.ca/mdetools/index.php?id=intelligent-house">Intelligent House</a>’ challenge problems have been addressed with the help of a particular MDE tool or tools,<br />
        (2) which kind of tangible benefit the chosen tool provides by, e.g., facilitating a relevant activity or task such as model creation, management, transformation, analysis, execution, testing, animation, simulation, code generation, simulation, or communication,<br />
        (3) strengths and weaknesses of the chosen tool in the context of the challenge problem.<br />
        Descriptions of the two challenge problems are available <a href="http://mase.cs.queensu.ca/mdetools/index.php?id=challenge-problems">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Comparisons and evaluations of MDE tools</strong> describe the tools compared or evaluated, the criteria used, the data collection process followed, and the results obtained in a novel, insightful way; models used and data collected should be made publicly available. Submissions describing novel ways in which comparisons and evaluations of tools can be encouraged or facilitated are also welcome.</li>
    <li><strong>Position papers</strong> describe a clearly identifiable position or opinion on a relevant topic in a well-argued, insightful way; papers discussing challenges to the development and dissemination of high quality MDE tools and supporting documentation and how they could be mitigated or removed are particularly encouraged.</li>
    <li><strong>Video tutorials</strong> demonstrate and showcase the use of an MDE tool for a particular task (or set of tasks) in an informative, accurate, attractive, and polished way. Submissions should be accompanied by a short summary containing<br />
        (1) a description of the contents of the tutorial including the tool and task(s) chosen, and<br />
        (2) a URL of the web location where the tutorial can be accessed and viewed.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EasyChair will be used to handle the submissions of papers in Categories I to III and of summaries of video tutorials. The submission link is:&nbsp;<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mdetools17">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mdetools17</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Format and size limits</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All submitted artifacts must use English. All textual documents must adhere to the Springer LNCS formatting guidelines (<a href="http://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://www.springer.com/us/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Descriptions of the use of a tool for the challenge problems (Category I), tool comparisons and evaluations (Category II), and position papers (Category III) should be between 6 and 10 pages in length. Video tutorials should not be longer than 5 minutes; the accompanying summary should not exceed 2 pages.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guidelines for submitting video tutorials are available <a href="http://mase.cs.queensu.ca/mdetools/index.php?id=video-tutorial-submission">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Publication</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accepted papers and summaries of accepted video tutorials will be published in the workshop proceedings which will be made available using the open-access publication service CEUR (<a href="http://ceur-ws.org">http://ceur-ws.org</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Evaluation process</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The submission and reviewing process will be handled using EasyChair. All submissions will be reviewed by at least three PC members. Acceptance decisions will be made based on standard criteria such as correctness, clarity, and originality, but also on the potential of the work to stimulate discussion, inspire participants, and contribute to the success of the workshop. Moreover, video tutorials should convey knowledge about how to use an MDE tool for a particular task or set of tasks in an accurate, clear, succinct, and easy-to-follow way; chosen tasks should be non-trivial and relevant to potential users; the tutorial should be attractive and polished and use the tutorial format effectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Submissions with workshop organizers as (co-)authors will be allowed, but care will be taken to enforce the standard conflict rules (<a href="http://www.sigsoft.org/about/policies/pc-policy.htm">http://www.sigsoft.org/about/policies/pc-policy.htm</a>) when assigning papers for review, collecting reviews, and discussing submissions.</p>
