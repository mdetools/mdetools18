<strong>9:15 - 10:30 </strong> &nbsp;     &nbsp;       | <strong>Session: Keynote</strong> <br /> <medium> &#x2219; Mattias Mohlin</medium> <br />[<small>Developing a Modeling Tool Someone Wants to Use: Challenges, trends and solutions for how to develop modeling tools that people actually can and want to use</small>]() <br/> <small> Mattias is a senior software architect at HCL Technologies Sweden. He has worked with the development of modelling tools for 20 years, and has for many years worked in close cooperation with big industrial users of such tools. Currently he is working on modelling tools for development of real-time and IoT applications, and also web-based tools for publishing and collaboration around models. When he is not thinking about modelling tools, he enjoys going on long bicycle rides, hiking, and spending time with the family. </small>|
