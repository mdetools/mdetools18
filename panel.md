# Hybrid textual/graphical modeling: quantum leap, incremental improvement, or distraction?

### Abstract:
As the industry is now moving towards IoT, 5G, and
digital transformation, the ever-increasing complexity of the software
and the need to deliver customized solutions faster and, possibly, on demand
is forcing organizations to revisit their way-of-working. Their
ability to succeed in the new economy appears to directly depend on
them achieving increasing levels of development and business agility
despite increasing demands and complexity. 

Model-Based Engineering (MBE) has proven to be highly successful
in many different industrial contexts over the last
decades. Modeling is used for a wide range of aspects, including,
software design, system engineering, information modeling, network
architecture, testing, enterprise architecture, and business
process modeling. As such, modeling is considered to be an
essential aspect of complex software and system development.
Nonetheless, a number of factors have been limiting a broader
adoption of MBE.

Today's market of modelling tools and Domain-Specific Modelling
Languages (DSML) is mainly divided in two categories, each having
advantages and disadvantages: one based on graphical modeling (e.g.,
UML tools, MathWorks Simulink/Matlab, EAST-ADL, and Microsoft Visual Studio),
and another based on textual modeling (Eclipse Xtext, MetaDepth, EMFText,
and JetBrains MPS). In general, graphical modeling tools are typically
better suited for describing and visualizing a set of entities and their
relationships as found, e.g., in software architectures and state machines.
However, they are also considered more cumbersome and less efficient to use
than textual editors. On the other hand, textual modelling tools are typically
considered easier to use by a majority of software engineers as they provide
widely-used and familiar editor capabilities (e.g., copy&paste, search&replace,
auto-completion, etc), but large systems and complex relationships can be
difficult to understand using textual representations.

Support for fully synchronized, hybrid textual/graphical modeling, that would
allow taking advantage of both representation formats and switching seamlessly
between them, has been proposed to increase development productivity
and agility. Over the last years, several research projects have investigated the
potential combination of textual and graphical modeling for different use cases,
including information modeling, system modeling, and software
development. While these projects have confirmed some of the main claimed
benefits of hybrid textual/graphical modeling, they also identified key issues
that need to be addressed to develop scalable industrial solutions.

In this panel, we will discuss
- Potential benefits of hybrid textual/graphical modelling
- Main issues and challenges associated with the development of industrial hybrid textual/graphical modelling solutions
- Existing products supporting some level of hybrid textual/graphical modelling
- Wanted solution, i.e., the properties that an ideal solution should have
